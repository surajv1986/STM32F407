Project Description: This project is supposed to control a LED using ambient light as a parameter, i.e if there is ambient light the LED should turn off, else 
if it is dark then led should turn on.

Hardware Required for the Project
1) 1 STM32F407VGT Micro-Controller
2) 1 Light Dependent Resistor
3) 1 LED

Interfacing Details

STM32F407VGT              LDR
Pin PD10                  one terminal
GND                       GND
							
STM32F407VGT			LED		
Pin A10                 Anode                 
GND                     GND


NOTE: Please use resistors of appropriate values for interfacing LED and LDR with micro-controller
